Mango Tree Disease Detection and Irrigation System
This project uses machine learning and hardware to detect diseases in mango leaves and provide automatic irrigation to affected areas.

1.Features:
*Detects mango leaf diseases in real-time.
*Activates targeted irrigation upon disease detection.
*Saves water and energy.
*Can be expanded for other crops.
*Logs disease detection and irrigation activities.
*Combines Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP camera, and a water pump.

2.Components Hardware:
*Raspberry Pi 4
*Arduino Uno
*Web cam
*Logitech Webcam
*Water Pump & Sprinkler
*Relay Module
*Battery (2200mAh)

3.Software:
TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV
Python
Arduino IDE

4.How It Works:
A webcam captures video of mango leaves.A machine learning model identifies diseases with a 70% confidence threshold.
If a disease is detected for 15 seconds, the water pump irrigates the affected area.

5.Future Additions
*Mobile app for monitoring.
*Cloud storage for disease data.
*Weather-based irrigation control.
*Support for other crops.
*This project promotes efficient, sustainable farming practices.
